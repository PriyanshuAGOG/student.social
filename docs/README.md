## 📝 Documentation Standards

All documentation in this folder follows these principles:
- ✅ **Essential** - Only contains useful, non-redundant information
- 🎯 **Organized** - Categorized by purpose (setup, architecture, deployment, testing)
- 📖 **Clear** - Easy to navigate and understand
- 🔄 **Updated** - Reflects current platform state

## 🗂️ What Was Removed

The following types of files were removed during organization:
- Status/completion reports (COMPLETION_CERTIFICATE, PHASE_2_COMPLETION_REPORT, etc.)
- Fix summaries (BACKEND_FIX_SUMMARY, APPWRITE_CRITICAL_FIX, etc.)
- Deployment status files (DEPLOYMENT_READY, READY_FOR_DEPLOYMENT, etc.)
- Temporary work status files (BACKEND_WORK_COMPLETE, PLATFORM_FIXES_COMPLETE, etc.)

These were removed to keep the documentation clean and focused on actionable, reference material rather than historical status updates.

## 🤝 Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:
1. Place it in the appropriate category folder
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames (kebab-case preferred)
3. Update this README with a link to your new doc
4. Keep documentation focused and actionable
