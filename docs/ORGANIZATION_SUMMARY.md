### 🎯 Key Documentation Preserved

✅ **Setup Guides** - 7 files for getting started
✅ **Architecture Documentation** - 5 files including detailed backend schema (2253 lines)
✅ **Deployment Instructions** - 3 files covering all deployment scenarios
✅ **Testing Guides** - 3 files for comprehensive testing
✅ **Quick References** - Direct access guides at root level

## 🚀 How to Use the New Structure

### For Quick Start
→ Open `docs/setup/quick-start.md`

### For Understanding the Platform
→ Read `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md` (detailed database schema, system design)
→ View `docs/architecture/visual-summary.md` (visual implementation overview)

### For Deployment
→ Follow `docs/deployment/deployment-instructions.md`

### For Testing
→ Use `docs/testing/complete-checklist.md`

## 📌 Main README Updated

The root `README.md` now points to the organized docs:
- Updated deployment links
- Added architecture documentation references
- Cleaner reference structure

## 🎉 Benefits

✅ **Well-Organized** - Documentation grouped by purpose
✅ **Easy Navigation** - Clear README with indexed sections
✅ **Professional Structure** - Industry-standard docs folder layout
✅ **Removed Noise** - Status/completion files eliminated
